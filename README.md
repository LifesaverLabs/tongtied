# Tongtied

**When Money Speaks, Legislators Can't**

Tongtied is an interactive web application that educates and advocates for campaign finance reform in the United States. The project demonstrates how campaign contributions and lobbying systematically prevent legislators from passing meaningful reform—essentially "tying their tongues" and preventing them from acting on conscience-driven policy changes.

## The Core Problem

Campaign finance corruption isn't just another issue—it's the foundational issue that prevents solving all other policy problems. This site draws heavily from Lawrence Lessig's work to show how money in politics creates a system where reform becomes structurally impossible.

## What's Inside

### Interactive Visualizations

- **Steric Hindrance Demo**: A chemistry-inspired visualization showing how donor contributions create "friction" that restricts legislative mobility
- **Entrenchment Visualization**: Explore the "web of donor relationships" that trap legislators in a cycle of obligation

### Evidence-Based Case Studies

Real-world examples demonstrating how money blocks reform:

- **NFL & Youth Sports**: How lobbying delays concussion protocols and CTE research
- **Tax Preparation Industry**: How lobbying blocks pre-filled tax returns (costing Americans $30B+ annually)
- **Tobacco Industry**: How contributions delay health reforms
- **Oil & Gas Industry**: How lobbying prevents climate legislation

### Educational Content

- **The Lessig Solution**: Learn about the "Referendum Presidency" concept and the Citizen Equality Act
- **Incumbency Analysis**: Why incumbents win 95%+ of elections and how money creates unbeatable advantages
- **Golden Handcuffs**: How financial ties and fundraising burdens trap legislators
